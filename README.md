# Simple RAG Project

This is a simple, end-to-end RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application. It uses a FastAPI backend, local AI models, and a local vector store to answer questions based on your private documents.

## âœ¨ Features

* **Ingests Local Files:** Reads `.pdf` and `.txt` files from a `/data` folder.
* **100% Local:** Uses free, local Hugging Face models (`sentence-transformers` and `flan-t5-base`) for embeddings and generation. No API keys needed.
* **Vector Search:** Uses `ChromaDB` to store and search for document chunks.
* **Web API:** Provides a robust FastAPI server with an `/ask` endpoint.
* **Easy Setup:** Fully containerized with Docker. Your manager can run it with one command.
